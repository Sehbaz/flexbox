# FLEXBOX EXAMPLE

## This project is created as to understand how flexbox  works.

The “Flexible Box” or “Flexbox” layout mode offers an alternative to Floats for defining the overall appearance of a web page. Whereas floats only let us horizontally position our boxes, flexbox gives us complete control over the alignment, direction, order, and size of our boxes.
Flexbox uses two types of boxes that we’ve never seen before: “flex containers” and “flex items”. The job of a flex container is to group a bunch of flex items together and define how they’re positioned.
